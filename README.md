# Module-4-Challenge

## Description
This program will ask 5 coding related questions. Each wrong answer subtracts time from the clock. The game ends when all questions are answered or time runs out.
High scores are saved to local memory so no scores are lost when program is refreshed or exited. The motivation for making this program is to test knowledge of coding
questions and compare scores with other users.
